# Overview

This page will contain all information on how to act as a `Content Creator`, and how to perform the various tasks required for the job.

# Instructions
Unlike some of the other current and future roles on the Joystream Platform, becoming a `Content Creator`
requires no extra software. Everything can be done in the browser, by going [here](http://testnet.joystream.org).

## Get Started
If you want to upload content as a `Content Creator`, you need to become a `Member`. Instructions for this
can be found [here](https://github.com/JoyStream/helpdesk/#get-started).

## Uploading Content
Once you are a member, it is extremely simple to get started uploading content to the platform.

First, visit the `Media` tab in the sidebar. You can then click on `New channel` in the top navigation bar to make your
first channel. Complete the form with the details for your channel.

Your channel will be `Public` by default. To upload content simply navigate to your channel and click the `Upload Video` button. From there you can upload video files before filling in their metadata and submitting them into the content directory.

<i>Please note: users have reported some issues with uploading on Chromium-based browsers. While we are currently working on a fix for this, for the moment it might be a good idea to use Firefox if you are a `Content Creator`.</i>

## Content Restrictions
It is very important that you do not upload illegal or copyrighted content on our testnets. This will result in a disqualification from payouts. It will also result in the takedown of content, potentially slashing of funds, and the deletion of your channel. Multiple spam uploads which represent a burden to moderate for the `Content Curators` may also be penalized and result in deductions on payouts due for qualifying content uploads on your content creator profile.
