# Overview

This page will contain all information on how to setup your storage node and becoming a `Storage Provider` on the Joystream Testnets. As we have decided to re-write the node from scratch instead of fixing the one currently active, there is currently no reason to run the node.

# Instructions
If you want to try just for fun of it, go [here](/old-instructions.md). Note that we will not provide support, and that the paid spots are already filled until [Acropolis](https://github.com/Joystream/joystream/tree/master/testnets/acropolis).
