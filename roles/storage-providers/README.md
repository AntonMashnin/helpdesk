# Overview

This page contains all information required to set up your storage node and become a `Storage Provider` on the current Joystream testnet.

The guide for the `Storage Provider Lead` can be found [here](/roles/storage-lead).

# Instructions

The instructions below will assume you are running as `root`. This makes the instructions somewhat easier, but less safe and robust.

Note that this has been tested on a fresh images of `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS`.

The system has shown to be quite resource intensive, so you should choose a VPS with specs equivalent to [Linode 8GB](https://www.linode.com/pricing?msclkid=eaa12e00529310e4665c730d6b01b014&utm_source=bing&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=Linode%20-%20Brand%20-%20Search%20-%20LowGeo&utm_term=linode&utm_content=Linode) or better (not an affiliate link).

Please note that unless there are any openings for new storage providers (which you can check in [Pioneer](https://testnet.joystream.org/) under `Working Groups` -> `Opportunities`), you will not be able to join. Applying to the an opening is easiest in Pioneer, but once hired, you no longer need it. Actions you may want to perform after getting hired is easiest to do with the [CLI](/tools/cli/README.md#working-groups). With this, you can configure things like:
- change your reward destination address
- change your role key
- increase your stake
- leave the role

## Initial setup
First of all, you need to connect to a fully synced [Joystream full node](https://github.com/Joystream/joystream/releases). By default, the program assumes you are running a node on the same device. For instructions on how to set this up, go [here](../validators). Note that you can disregard all the parts about keys before applying, and just install the software so it is ready to go.
We strongly encourage that you run both the [node](../validators#run-as-a-service) and the other software below as a service.

First, you need to setup `node`, `npm` and `yarn`. This is sometime troublesome to do with the `apt` package manager. Go [here](#install-yarn-and-node-on-linux) to do this if you are not confident in your abilities to navigate the rough seas.

Now, get the additional dependencies:
```
$ apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y
$ apt-get install git build-essential libtool automake autoconf python
# on debian 9
$ apt-get install libcap2-bin
```

## Install ipfs
The new storage node uses [ipfs](https://ipfs.io/) as backend.
```
$ wget https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/releases/download/v0.6.0/go-ipfs_v0.6.0_linux-amd64.tar.gz
$ tar -xvzf go-ipfs_v0.6.0_linux-amd64.tar.gz
$ cd go-ipfs
$ ./ipfs init --profile server
$ ./install.sh
# start ipfs daemon:
$ ipfs daemon
```
If you see `Daemon is ready` at the end, you are good!

### Run ipfs as a service

To ensure high uptime, it's best to set the system up as a `service`.

Example file below:

```
$ nano /etc/systemd/system/ipfs.service
# Paste in everything below the stapled line
---
[Unit]
Description=ipfs
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=root
WorkingDirectory=/root
LimitNOFILE=8192
PIDFile=/var/run/ipfs/ipfs.pid
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/ipfs daemon
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=3
StartLimitInterval=600

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
Save and exit. Close the `ipfs daemon` if it's still running, then:
```
$ systemctl start ipfs
# If everything works, you should get an output. Verify with:
$ systemctl status ipfs
# If you see something else than "Daemon is ready" at the end, try again in a couple of seconds.
# To have ipfs start automatically at reboot:
$ systemctl enable ipfs
# If you want to stop ipfs, either to edit the file or some other reason:
$ systemctl stop ipfs
```

### Upgrade ipfs
If you have previously ran a storage-node with an older version of ipfs, you should now upgrade, as there has been some stability issues with older versions on the the newest storage-node.

```
# If you are running ipfs as a service:
# systemctl stop ipfs
# If you are running it in some other way, kill the process.
# Then:
$ wget https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/releases/download/v0.6.0/go-ipfs_v0.6.0_linux-amd64.tar.gz
$ tar -xvzf go-ipfs_v0.6.0_linux-amd64.tar.gz
$ cd go-ipfs
$ ./install.sh
$ ipfs daemon
# Which will return something like:
Initializing daemon...
go-ipfs version: 0.6.0
Repo version: 10
System version: amd64/linux
Golang version: go1.14.4
Found outdated fs-repo, migrations need to be run.
Run migrations now? [y/N]
# After confirming, you can restart ipfs
```

## Setup Hosting
In order to allow for users to upload and download, you have to setup hosting, with an actual domain as both Chrome and Firefox requires `https://`. If you have a "spare" domain or subdomain you don't mind using for this purpose, go to your domain registrar and point your domain to the IP you want. If you don't, you must unfortunately go purchase one.

To configure SSL-certificates the easiest is to use [caddy](https://caddyserver.com/), but feel free to take a different approach. Note that if you are using caddy for commercial use, you need to acquire a license. Please check their terms and make sure you comply with what is considered personal use.

The instructions below are designed for `Caddy Version 1` but this will of course work in a similar way for the latest version:

```
$ curl https://getcaddy.com | bash -s personal
# Allow caddy access to required ports:
$ setcap 'cap_net_bind_service=+ep' /usr/local/bin/caddy
$ ulimit -n 8192
```

Configure caddy with `nano ~/Caddyfile` and paste in the following:

```
# Storage Node API
https://<your.cool.url> {
    proxy / localhost:3000 {
        transparent
    }
    header / {
        Access-Control-Allow-Origin  *
        Access-Control-Allow-Methods "GET, PUT, HEAD, OPTIONS"
    }
}
```
Now you can check if you configured correctly, with:
```
$ /usr/local/bin/caddy --validate --conf ~/Caddyfile
# Which should return:
Caddyfile is valid

# You can now run caddy with:
$ (screen) /usr/local/bin/caddy --agree --email <your_mail@some.domain> --conf ~/Caddyfile
```
After a short wait, you should see:
```
YYYY/MM/DD HH:NN:SS [INFO] [<your.cool.url>] Server responded with a certificate.
done.

Serving HTTPS on port 443
https://<your.cool.url>


Serving HTTP on port 80
https://<your.cool.url>

```

### Run caddy as a service
To ensure high uptime, it's best to set the system up as a `service`.

Example file below:

```
$ nano /etc/systemd/system/caddy.service
# Paste in everything below the stapled line
---
[Unit]
Description=Reverse proxy for storage node
After=network.target

[Service]
User=root
WorkingDirectory=/root
LimitNOFILE=8192
PIDFile=/var/run/caddy/caddy.pid
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/caddy -agree -email <your_mail@some.domain> -pidfile /var/run/caddy/caddy.pid -conf /root/Caddyfile
Restart=on-failure
StartLimitInterval=600


[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
Save and exit. Close `caddy` if it's still running, then:
```
$ systemctl start caddy
# If everything works, you should get an output. Verify with:
$ systemctl status caddy
# Which should produce something like:
---
‚óè caddy.service - Reverse proxy for storage node

---
# To have caddy start automatically at reboot:
$ systemctl enable caddy
# If you want to stop caddy, either to edit the file or some other reason:
$ systemctl stop caddy
```

## Install and Setup the Storage Node

First, you need to clone the Joystream monorepo, which contains the storage software.
Note that if you already have a storage-node installed (or running), go [here](#update-your-storage-node)

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Joystream/joystream.git
$ cd joystream
$ yarn install
$ yarn run colossus --help
```
You can set the PATH to avoid the `yarn run` prefix by:
```
$ cd ~/joystream/storage-node/packages/colossus
$ yarn link
# Test that it's working with:
$ colossus --help
# It should now work globally
```

## Update Your Storage Node
To update your storage-node from an old network, do the following steps:

```
# If you are running as service (which you should)
$ systemctl stop storage-node
$ git clone https://github.com/Joystream/joystream.git
$ cd joystream
$ yarn install
$ yarn run colossus --help
```

If you have been running a storage node before, and used `.bash_profile` to avoid the `yarn run` prefix, you need to:
`$ nano ~/.bash_profile`
Then, uncomment or remove the lines below:
```
# Colossus
alias colossus="/root/storage-node-joystream/packages/colossus/bin/cli.js"  
alias helios="/root/storage-node-joystream/packages/helios/bin/cli.js"
```
For helios, you can instead change the path from `/root/storage-node-joystream/packages/helios/bin/cli.js` -> `/root/joystream/storage-node/packages/helios/bin/cli.js`
Then:

```
$ . ~/.bash_profile
$ cd ~/joystream/storage-node/packages/colossus
$ yarn link
# Test that it's working with:
$ colossus --help
```
It should now work globally.

### Applying for a Storage Provider opening

Click [here](https://testnet.joystream.org) to open the `Pioneer app` in your browser. Then follow instructions [here](https://github.com/Joystream/helpdesk#get-started) to generate a set of `Keys`, get tokens, and sign up for a `Membership`. This `key` will be referred to as the `member` key.

Make sure to save the `5YourJoyMemberAddress.json` file. This key will require tokens to be used as stake for the `Storage Provider` application (`application stake`) and further stake may be required if you are selected for the role (`role stake`).

To check for current openings, visit [this page](https://testnet.joystream.org/#/working-groups/opportunities) on Pioneer and look for any `Storage Provider` applications which are open for applications. If there is an opening available, fill in the details requested in the form required and stake the tokens needed to apply (when prompted you can sign a transaction for this purpose).

During this process you will be provided with a role key, which will be made available to download in the format `5YourStorageAddress.json`. If you set a password for this key, remember it :)

The next steps (below) will only apply if you are a succesful applicant.


### Setup and configure the storage node

**Make sure your [Joystream full node](https://github.com/Joystream/joystream/releases) is fully synced before you move to the next step(s)!**

Assuming you are running the storage node on a VPS via ssh, on your local machine:

```
# Go the directory where you saved your <5YourStorageAddress.json>:
$ scp <5YourStorageAddress.json> <user>@<your.vps.ip.address>:/path/to/joystream/storage-node/
```
Your `5YourStorageAddress.json` should now be where you want it.

On the machine/VPS you want to run your storage node:

```
# If you are not already in that directory:
$ cd /path/to/joystream/storage-node
```
On our older testnets, at this point you would have to "apply" using a separate colossus command to any available storage role. With the evolution of our testnet and the introduction of the `Storage Working Group`, this is no longer necessary. The next steps simply require that you link the "role key" (`5YourStorageAddress.json`) and `Storage ID` to your storage server.

To check your `Storage ID`, you have two (easy) options:
1. Use the [CLI](/tools/cli/README.md#working-groups:overview)
2. Check [Pioneer](https://testnet.joystream.org/#/working-groups)


```
# To make sure everything is running smoothly, it would be helpful to run with DEBUG.
# If you used "yarn link":
$ DEBUG=* colossus server --key-file <5YourStorageAddress.json> --public-url https://<your.cool.url> --provider-id ID <your_storage-id>

# If not:
$ cd ~/joystream
$ DEBUG=* yarn run colossus server --key-file <5YourStorageAddress.json> --public-url https://<your.cool.url> --provider-id ID <your_storage-id>

# If you set a passphrase for <5YourStorageAddress.json>:
$ DEBUG=* (yarn run) colossus server --key-file <5YourStorageAddress.json> --passphrase <your_passphrase> --public-url https://<your.cool.url> --provider-id ID <your_storage-id>
```

If you do this, you should see something like:

```
discovery::publish { name: 'QmPwws576n3ByE6CQUvUt3dgmokk2XN2cJgPYHWoM6SSUS',
discovery::publish   value: '/ipfs/QmeDAWGRjbWx6fMCxtt95YTSgTgBhhtbk1qsGkteRXaEST' } +391ms
```

If everything is working smoothly, you will now start syncing the `content directory`.

Note that unless you run this is a [service](#run-storage-node-as-a-service), you now have to open a second terminal for the remaining steps.

#### Check that you are syncing
In your second terminal window:
```
$ ipfs bitswap wantlist
---
# Output should be a long list of keys, eg. Note that it might take a few minutes before the actual content from the Joystream content directory shows up.
---
QmeszeBjBErFQrkiQPh8QhTs3hfCEGJuK2jNopatHnps1k
...
QmfCbUsYhKBmrdop3yFrerqVKwBJvY5tbpV1cf9Cx3L1J8
```
If you did this immediately after FIRST starting your storage node, the `wantlist` might be empty. Give it a minute, and it should contain at least the number of items in the content directory. You can also check what content you have stored by:
```
ipfs refs local
---
# Output should be an even longer list of keys, eg.
---
QmeszeBjBErFQrkiQPh8QhTs3hfCEGJuK2jNopatHnps1k
Qmezum3AWdxkm1AtHe35DZGWdfhTQ4PVmmZatGwDL68RES
...
QmfCCjC5w9wxTFoAaJ947ss2oc1jx6R2mM9xjU7Ccrq55M
QmfCbUsYhKBmrdop3yFrerqVKwBJvY5tbpV1cf9Cx3L1J8
```

In your first terminal (where) the storage node is running, you will soon enough see this:
```
...
joystream:runtime:base TX status: Finalized +7ms
joystream:runtime:base TX Finalized. +1ms
joystream:sync sync run complete +0ms
```

In the second terminal:
```
$ ipfs refs local
```
Should return nothing.

### Run storage node as a service

To ensure high uptime, it's best to set the system up as a `service`. Note that this will not work if you set a password for your `<5YourStorageAddress.json> `.

Example file below:

```
$ nano /etc/systemd/system/storage-node.service
# Paste in everything below the stapled line
---
[Unit]
Description=Joystream Storage Node
After=network.target ipfs.service joystream-node.service

[Service]
User=root
WorkingDirectory=/root/joystream/storage-node
LimitNOFILE=8192
Environment=DEBUG=*
ExecStart=/usr/local/lib/nodejs/node-v12.18.2-linux-x64/bin/node packages/colossus/bin/cli.js \
        --key-file <5YourStorageAddress.json> \
        --public-url https://<your.cool.url \
        --provider-id ID <your_storage-id>
Restart=on-failure
StartLimitInterval=600

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
Save and exit. Close the running `colossus` if it's still running, then:
```
$ systemctl start storage-node
# If everything works, you should get an output. Verify with:
$ systemctl status storage-node
# Which should produce something like:
---

# To have colossus start automatically at reboot:
$ systemctl enable storage-node
# If you want to stop the storage node, either to edit the storage-node.service file or some other reason:
$ systemctl stop storage-node
```

### Verify everything is working

In your browser, find and click on an uploaded media file [here](https://testnet.joystream.org//#/media/), then open the developer console, and find the URL of the asset. Copy the `<content-id>`, ie. whatever comes after the last `/`.

Then paste the following in your browser:

`https://<your.cool.url>/asset/v0/<content-id>`.

If the content starts playing, that means you are good!

# Troubleshooting
If you had any issues setting it up, you may find your answer here!

## Port not set

If you get an error like this:
```
Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::3000
```

It most likely means your port is blocked. This could mean your storage-node is already running (in which case you may want to kill it unless it's as a service), or that another program is using the port.

In case of the latter, you can specify a new port (e.g. 3001) with the `--port 3001` flag.

## Install yarn and node on linux

Go [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and find the newest (LTS) binary for your distro. This guide will assume 64-bit linux, and `node-v12.18.2`.

If you want to install as `root`, so your user can use `npm` without `sudo` privileges, go [here](#install-as-root).

If you want to install as another user (must have `sudo` privileges), go [here](#install-as-user-with-sudo-privileges).

Alternatives such as [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [nodesource](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions/blob/master/README.md) are also worth considering.

#### Install as Root
This section assumes you are installing as `root`. It also demonstrates how you can provide another user access without having to use `sudo`. It doesn't matter if user `joystream` has `sudo` privileges or not.

```
$ wget https://nodejs.org/dist/v12.18.2/node-v12.18.2-linux-x64.tar.xz
$ mkdir -p /usr/local/lib/nodejs
$ tar -xJvf node-v12.18.2-linux-x64.tar.xz -C /usr/local/lib/nodejs
$ nano ~/.bash_profile
---
Append the following lines:
---
# Nodejs
VERSION=v12.18.2
DISTRO=linux-x64
export PATH=/usr/local/lib/nodejs/node-$VERSION-$DISTRO/bin:$PATH
```
Save and exit, then:
```
$ source ~/.bash_profile
# Verify version:
$ node -v
$ npm -v
$ npx -v
# Install yarn
$ npm install yarn -g
# If everything looks ok, and you want to allow user joystream access:
$ chown -R joystream /usr/local/lib/nodejs
```
Log in to joystream:
```
$ su joystream
$ cd
# Repeat the .bash_profile config:
$ nano ~/.bash_profile
---
Append the following lines:
---
# Nodejs
VERSION=v12.18.2
DISTRO=linux-x64
export PATH=/usr/local/lib/nodejs/node-$VERSION-$DISTRO/bin:$PATH
```
Save and exit, then:
```
$ source ~/.bash_profile
# Verify that it works:
$ node -v
$ npm -v
$ npx -v
$ yarn -v
```

You have now successfully installed the newest (LTS) versions of `npm`, `node` and `yarn`.

#### Install as user with `sudo` privileges
This section assumes the steps are performed as user `joystream` with `sudo` privileges.

As `joystream`
```
$ wget https://nodejs.org/dist/v12.18.2/node-v12.18.2-linux-x64.tar.xz
$ mkdir -p /usr/local/lib/nodejs
$ tar -xJvf node-v12.18.2-linux-x64.tar.xz -C /usr/local/lib/nodejs
$ nano ~/.bash_profile
---
Append the following lines:
---
# Nodejs
VERSION=v12.18.2
DISTRO=linux-x64
export PATH=/usr/local/lib/nodejs/node-$VERSION-$DISTRO/bin:$PATH
```
Save and exit, then:
```
$ source ~/.bash_profile
$ sudo chown -R joystream /usr/local/lib/nodejs
# Verify that it works:
$ node -v
$ npm -v
$ npx -v
# Install yarn
$ npm install yarn -g
# Verify that it works:
$ yarn -v
```
If you want `root` to be able to use `npm` as well:

```
$ sudo su
$ nano ~/.bash_profile
---
Append the following lines:
---
# Nodejs
VERSION=v12.18.2
DISTRO=linux-x64
export PATH=/usr/local/lib/nodejs/node-$VERSION-$DISTRO/bin:$PATH
```
Save and exit, then:

`$ source ~/.bash_profile`

You have now successfully installed the newest (LTS) versions of `npm`, `node` and `yarn`.
