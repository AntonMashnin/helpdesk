## Overview
This page contains information on how you can contribute in building the Joystream platform. Either through reporting [bugs and issues](#bug-reporters), or helpings become a [builder](#builders) and contribute code.

## Bug Reporters
As with all software, and especially the early versions, there will be plenty of bugs, enhancements and missing features. Both to improve as we go, and to "train" a group of testers and developers for an autonomous platform, we want outsiders to contribute already.

#### Instructions
If you find a bug in any of our software, reporting them as `Issues` in the correct [repo](https://github.com/Joystream/joystream#repository-index) would allow us to address this. As stated [here](https://github.com/Joystream/helpdesk#builders-and-bug-reporters), it might also qualify for a bounty. If you find an error, something unclear or just missing in the guides in this repo, the same concept applies.

As a general note, in addition to the severity of the bug, and the more details you include in the `Issue`, the bigger the reward will be. Example of a detailed `Issue`:
* For nodes and software ran on your computer
  * Logs and crash reports (from one of the nodes)
  * Steps to reproduce
  * Your environment (eg. operating system and version)
  * etc.
* If related to our `Pioneer` [testnet](https://testnet.joystream.org) apps:
  * What (if any) error message did you seed
  * What were you trying to do
  * What is your address
  * What is your balance
  * What is the type of `key` (ie. `Schnorrkel` or `Edwards`)
  * Are you a `Member`
  * Is the `key` used for another role
  * etc.

If you want to go the extra mile and try to resolve the issue yourself for a bigger bounty, click [here](#instructions-1).

## Builders
As with all software, and especially the early versions, there will be plenty of bugs, enhancements and missing features. Both to improve as we go, and to "train" a group of testers and developers for an autonomous platform, we want outsiders to contribute already.

#### Instructions
As an open sourced project, we try to follow the standard conventions and workflow.

If you find a bug, or want to improve or add something in the code, documentations or guides, locate the correct repo from in [index](https://github.com/Joystream/joystream#repository-index). Fork the repo, make the changes you want to address, and create a `Pull request`. For both your own and our convenience, it would be nice if you raised an `Issue` first so we can agree on the scope, size of the bounty and make ensure this is something we want/need.
