## Overview
This page contains information on how you can contribute to building the Joystream platform. You can help out either through reporting [bugs and issues](#bug-reporters), or by becoming a [builder](#builders) and contributing code.

## Bug Reporters
As with all software, and especially the early versions, there will be plenty of bugs, missing features and enhancements required. Both to improve as we go, and to "train" a group of testers and developers for our autonomous platform, we want _outsiders_ to start contributing as soon as possible.

#### Instructions
If you find a bug in any of our software, reporting them as `Issues` in the correct repo will allow us to address this. In some cases, reports might also qualify for a bounty. If you find an error, something unclear or just missing in the guides in this repo, the [same concept applies](https://github.com/Joystream/bounties/issues/3).

As a general note, in addition to the severity of the bug, the more details you include in the `Issue`, the bigger the reward will be. Example of a detailed `Issue`:
* For nodes and software ran on your computer
  * Logs and crash reports (from one of the nodes)
  * Steps to reproduce
  * Your environment (eg. operating system and version)
  * etc.
* If related to our `Pioneer` [testnet](https://testnet.joystream.org) app:
  * What (if any) error message did you see?
  * What were you trying to do?
  * What is your address?
  * What is your balance?
  * What is the type of `key` (ie. `Schnorrkel` or `Edwards`)?
  * Are you a `Member`?
  * Is the `key` used for another role?
  * etc.

If you want to go the extra mile and try to resolve the issue yourself for a bigger bounty, click [here](#instructions-1).

#### Instructions
As an open sourced project, we try to follow the standard conventions and workflow.

If you find a bug, or want to improve or add something in the code, documentations or guides, locate the correct repo from the organization [index](https://github.com/Joystream). Fork the repo, make the changes you want to address, and create a `Pull request`. For our mutual convenience, it would be nice if you raised an `Issue` first, so we can agree on the scope, the size of the bounty and make sure this is something we want/need.
